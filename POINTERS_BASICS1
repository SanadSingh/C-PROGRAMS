      SYNTAX to store location of first element of an array of data type
      'data_type' is :
      data_type* pointer_name=ARRAY_NAME
      or
      data_type* pointer_name=&ARRAY_NAME[0];
      
      The above statement means that pointer_name is assigned the address of the
      first element of array.
      
      printf("%d",pointer_name);
      printf("%d",&ARRAY_NAME[0]);
      printf("%d",ARRAY_NAME);
      
      These three statemnets will print the same output i.e location of first
      element.

      SYNTAX to store location of element index no. : i of an array of data type
      'data_type' is :
      data_type* pointer_name=&ARRAY_NAME[i];
      
      The above statement means that pointer_name is assigned the address of the
      (i+1)th element of array.
      
      printf("%d",pointer_name);
      printf("%d",&ARRAY_NAME[i]);
      
      These two statemnets will print the same output i.e location of (i+1)th
      element.

      WE CAN ALSO PRINT THE VALUE OF THE OTHER ARRAY ELEMENTS USING THE POINTER TO FIRST ELEMENT.
      
      LOGIC : 
      
      ALL THE ELEMENTS OF ARRAY ARE STORED IN THE FASHION SAME AS THAT OF ROOMS IN A HOSTEL, I.E CONSECUTIVELY.
      THEREFORE THE ADDRESS OF THE VARIABLES HAVE A CONSTANT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THEM
      LIKE THE ROOM NUMBERS OF THE HOTEL
      
      
      
       printf("The value of element no. 4 is : %d\n",(*(arr + 3)));
       
       IT IS LIKE GOING TO THE ROOM INDEX NO.3 IN THE HOTEL WHERE INDEX BEGINS FROM ZERO
       
       ABOVE STATEMENT IS SELF EXPLANATORY
