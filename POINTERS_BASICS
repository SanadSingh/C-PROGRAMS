  /* '&' operator is used to refer to the adddress of a variable, therefore pointer to 'a'
  in the above program i.e (ptra) and (&a) give the same thing on printing on output screen that is address of the variable
  'a'
  
  To store address of an int variable , you need to make an int pointer,To store address of a char variable you need to make a char pointer and so on
  
  DECLARATION SYNTAX : data_type* pointer_name ;
  
  '*' operator is used as dereference operator also called indirecction operator is used to get value
  of the given address*/
