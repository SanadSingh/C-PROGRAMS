/* Program to understand local and global variables 

Very easy to understand
As the name suggests global variable can be accessed from anywhere whereas 
Local variable can be accessed from its respective function only

Global variable are not a part of any function.
Local variable are always a part of function be it main function or some other function

Local variable and Global variable can have the same name.

Working :

Compiler will always try to check whether variable is available locally. If it is not available locally then it will try finding
the global variable of the same name*/

int global = 619;
int loc=92;

int main()
{
    int loc=9;
    
    cout<<"Value of local variable is : "<<loc;
    cout<<"\nValue of global variable is : "<<global;
    return(0);
}

/*  Compilation began from main method , it found the value of loc within the function therefore it didnt searched for it 
outside the function

When the compiler couldn't find the value of variable global therefore it printed the value of global variable  */
