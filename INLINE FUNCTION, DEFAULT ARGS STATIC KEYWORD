MORE ABOUT STATIC VARIABLES :

Static variables in a Function: When a variable is declared as static, space for it gets allocated for the lifetime of the program. Even if the function is called multiple times, space for the static variable is allocated only once and the value of variable in the previous call gets carried through the next function 

// C++ program to demonstrate
// the use of static Static
// variables in a Function
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;
 
void demo()
{
    // static variable
    static int count = 0;
    cout << count << " ";
     
    // value is updated and
    // will be carried to next
    // function calls
    count++;
}
 
int main()
{
    for (int i=0; i<5; i++)    
        demo();
    return 0;
}
