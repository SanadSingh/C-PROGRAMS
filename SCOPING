//AIM : TO EXLPLAIN Scoping of variables
/*
THEORY : YOU CAN USE THE VARIABLE ONLY INSIDE THE BLOCK OF CODE IN WHICH IT IS DECLARED .
DECLARATION MEANS WRITING int i, int x, int y......

FOR EX int i was declared in the loop so it can be used only in the for loop and 
not somewhere outside of it

its like a local variable

    cout<<i<<endl;
    //The above line will give an error saying i was not decalred
